I am currently pursuing a Ph.D. in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Drexel University under Dr. David Han’s supervision. My research interests are in perception and robotics, especially how deep learning and computer vision can make robotic systems more capable in the real world. Currently my research focuses on the areas of scene understanding, monocular depth estimation, dynamic map prediction, and small object detection.

I received my B.Sc. in Mechanical Engineering from Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology in 2021, and my M.Sc. in Robotics from Worcester Polytechnic Institute in 2023. During my M.Sc. I also worked as a Software Engineer at Superlative Technologies Inc, a DoD Contractor for the U.S. Transportation Command. Apart from research, I have a wide variety of hobbies ranging from blacksmithing to solving Rubik’s Cubes.
