The annual Robot in 30 Hours challenge (and other speed-builds, such as Robot in 3 Days and Robot in 1 Weekend) originated from teams and alumni in the <a href='https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/ftc'>FIRST Tech Challenge</a> robotics program who wanted to complete speed-prototypes of robot designs to complete the annual game challenge. This served both as a method for teams to share ideas and test out their designs, and as a way for alumni to remain involved in the program and pass on their experience.

I have completed the Robot in 30 Hours challenge with some other alumni every year since 2017, with the annual robot reveals posted to your <a href='https://www.youtube.com/@Robotin30Hours'>YouTube channel</a>. Feel free to check them out!
